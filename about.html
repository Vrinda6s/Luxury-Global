        <h1>A Discreet Luxury Travel House</h1>
        <p class="about-subtitle">Built on trust, precision, and personal care.</p>
        <p class="about-intro">
            Luxury Global is a boutique luxury travel curation house specialising in bespoke journeys for HNI and Ultra-HNI travellers. We design highly personalised experiences across the world with a focus on discretion, depth, and long-term relationships.
        </p>
        <p class="about-intro">
            From private island retreats and ultra-luxury resorts to curated family celebrations and once-in-a-lifetime experiences, every journey is thoughtfully crafted, never mass produced and never transactional.

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="philosophy-text" style="color: #d4af37;">
            We do not believe luxury is about excess. We believe it is about intention.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Luxury Global, we don't chase volume — we curate meaning. Every itinerary begins with listening, understanding personal preferences, and honouring the trust our clients place in us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our work is rooted in patience, discretion, and an uncompromising commitment to excellence. Because true luxury is felt quietly, in details most people never notice.

                    <p>
                        We specialise in experiences that value privacy, refinement, and authenticity,
                        away from crowded and commercialised travel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our clients seek peace, space, and emotional connection.
                        That is the luxury we understand, and the luxury we curate.

                    <h2>Understanding the Indian Luxury Traveller</h2>
                    <p>
                        With decades of experience serving Indian HNI and Ultra-HNI families,
                        we deeply understand cultural nuances, family dynamics, and expectations
                        that define luxury for Indian travellers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This insight allows us to curate journeys that feel instinctively right,
                        respectful, seamless, and deeply personal.
